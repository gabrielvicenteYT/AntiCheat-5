# AntiCheat
The source code of the AntiCheat series on YouTube.

Note: Please do not copy and paste this tutorial, because this repository is made for people that want to look through the code, or if they have errors. Second, this repository doesn't contain all of it checks, because i've lost the files. (I have them now but I haven't had time to implement this)
